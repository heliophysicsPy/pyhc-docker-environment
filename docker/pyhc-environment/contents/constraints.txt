# PyHC Environment Version Constraints
# ============================================
# This file controls which package versions are
# acceptable. Uses standard pip constraint syntax.
#
# Common constraint types:
#   package!=X.Y.Z   Avoid specific broken version
#   package<X.Y.Z    Stay below threshold
#   package==X.Y.Z   Freeze at exact version
#
# The auto-pin process will pin packages to the
# latest PyPI versions that satisfy these constraints.
