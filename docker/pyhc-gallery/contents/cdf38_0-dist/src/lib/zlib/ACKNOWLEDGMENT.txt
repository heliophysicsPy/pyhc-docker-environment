This directory contains some of the compression/decompression codes from zlib,
(@zlib.net) of version 1.2.11, written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler. 
Only the .c and .h source codes are included from the package without any 
change to support the gzip functionality provided in the CDF.

To eleminate the double definitions between CDF and fits/netCDF/HDF whiling using
zlib, constant variable array z_errmsg is renamed to z_errmsg3 in zutil.c 
and zutil.h.

Refer to zlib.h for its copyright notice. Read README for its information.
