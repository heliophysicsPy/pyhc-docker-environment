# ============================================
# PyHC Environment Version Constraints
# ============================================
# This file blocks known-broken package versions.
# Uses standard pip constraint syntax.
#
# Example: sciqlop!=0.10.4
#
# The auto-pin process will pin packages to latest
# PyPI versions, except these constraints ensure
# known-broken versions are never installed.
# ============================================

# SciQLop v0.10.4 has unresolvable dependency conflicts
# sciqlop!=0.10.4
